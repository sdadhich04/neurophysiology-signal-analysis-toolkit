%inputs: aligned_spike_times - cell {#channels x 1} with vector (#spikes x 1)
%                               with trial-aligned time-stamps for each
%                               detected spike for a given unit
%         aligned_spike_labels - cell {#channels x 1} with vector (#spikes x 1)
%                                with label of the trial# each spike
%                                belongs to
%        time_before - time prior to alignment event to load for a
%                      given trial (in seconds)
%        time_after  - time after alignment event to load for a
%                      given trial (in seconds)
%        bin_width   - width of time-bin to use for estimating spike rate
%                      (in seconds)
%
%outputs: trial_spike_rate    - matrix [#trials x time x #channels] of estimated spike-rates for each trial/unit
%         time_bins           - vector (#time points x 1) of the center of
%                               the time-bin over which firing rate is estimated. (in seconds)
