%[fig_handle] = plotRaster(aligned_spike_times, aligned_spike_labels)
%   Function to make a raster plot of trial-aligned spike times
%   Only plots a figure for a SINGLE channel
%   If no figure/axis provided, creates a new figure and axis.
%   If a figure and/or axis is provided, will draw raster there.
%
%inputs: aligned_spike_times - vector [#spikes x 1] with spike time-stamps, trial-aligned
%        aligned_spike_labels - vector [#spikes x 1] with labels (trial #) for each spike
%        fig_handle - handle to the figure to use for plot (optional. If
%                     not provided or empty, will make a new figure and axes)
%        ax_handle - handle to the axes to use for plot (optional. If not
%                    provided or empty, will make new axes)
%outputs: fig_handle - handle to the figure created with the raster plot.
%         ax_handle  - handle to the axes created with the raster plot.
