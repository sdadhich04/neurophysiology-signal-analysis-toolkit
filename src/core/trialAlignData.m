%[trial_data] = trialAlignData(data, align_times, time_before, time_after, Fs)
%aligns a data time-series (data) to the align_times. Returns
%time-series data segments that are [time_before+time_after] long for each trial that
%begin time_before prior to the trial-event
%
%input:
%       data         - data to trial sort. [time x n] matrix, where n is # variables.
%       align_times  - time of trial events to align to [#trials x 1]. Time units must be
%                      consistent with sampling rate (e.g. if event-times in seconds, Fs must be in Hz)
%       time_before  - time before event-code occurence to include in data (in units consistent with Fs)
%       time_after   - total length of trial-aligned data segments (in units consistent with Fs)
%       Fs           - sampling rate
%output:
%       trial_data - Trial-aligned data [trials x time x n]
