%now we need to use our channel 1 inputs to detect stimulation events.

%1. Use 'detectSpikes.m' to find when the stimulation pulse occurs in channel 1
threshold = -0.2; %FILLIN--you may need to modify the threshold for your data--look at previous plots to determine the best threshold to use
[stim_times, stim_waveforms] = detectSpikes(data(:,1), threshold, FS);

%2. The stimulation waveform is complex and will cross our threshold several times for a single stimulation event.
%To remove these 'extra' detected stimulation times, we can use our knowledge that stimulation pulse timing.
%We know that stimulation pulses should not be _very_ close together.
MIN_STIM_DELTA = 0.005;
dt_stim = diff(stim_times); %use 'diff' to find the time between detected stimulation pulses
too_short = find(dt_stim<MIN_STIM_DELTA); %find pulses that are too close together.
use_pulse = setdiff(1:length(stim_times), too_short); %pulses to keep are all the other ones. setdiff(A,B) returns all the values in the vector A that are NOT in vector B.
stim_times_cleaned = stim_times(use_pulse);


%now that we have the stimulation times, we can use them to trial-align the force pulses
%to the time of stimulation. 
%This operation (logic and steps) are the same as when we trial-aligned
%spike times, but we now have a continuous variable (a force)
%rather than a discrete variable (spike times).
%We've provided a shell function trialAlignData.m to perform these
%computations. Open it and finish filling it in.
align_times = stim_times_cleaned; %FILLIN
time_before = 0.05;

[trial_force] = trialAlignData(data(:,2), align_times, time_before, time_after, FS); %FILLIN. reminder: the force data is the second column in your data set. We only want to align the force data.

%create a time-axis for our trial-aligned data (since trial_data itself is
%in samples)

%In your plot above, it's clear there's a shift in the average force across trials.
%This does not come from the stimulation, but from other sources of variability.
%for instance, how much the subject is pushing on the sensor may vary across time, shifting the 'baseline' force
%The twitch force profile is observed on top of that drifting baseline.
%Let's clean up our force pulse data a bit to remove this extra variability in baseline force.
%We will do this by subtracting the force at the time of stimulation (i.e. the 'baseline' force) from each trial individually
%This zeros out any differences in baseline across trials
baseline_idx = find(trial_time>=0, 1, 'first');

%hint: look at the help for 'repmat'. Use it to duplicate trial_baseline_force in the right way so that it's [#trials #time_points].
