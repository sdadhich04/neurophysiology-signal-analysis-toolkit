% we will first load a data file and test our pre-processing and calculations on one file. Once that is complete, we can extend our analysis to all data to examine trends.
%% testing pre-processing and calculations

% Define some basic things to make it easy to find your data files.
% We will want to take advantage of systematic naming structure in our data files.
% Your files should have names like [prefix][date][id #].
% Note that the SpikeRecorder program automatically saves files with date and time in the name.
% We recommend re-naming your files to convert time into a simpler id# e.g. 1, 2, 3...

% load your data file and the sampling rate into matlab into the variables 'data' and FS, respectively.

%now let's trial-align our EMG to the time of force onset

%1. load an 'events' file.
%Use the readEventsFile.m function you used in lab 2 to load up the data
events_file_type = '-events.txt';
events_file_name = [dataDir '\' file_prefix file_date '_' num2str(file_idnum) events_file_type];

[EVENTS, EVENT_TIMES] = readEventsFile(events_file_name);


%2. Align your data to the trial-events.
%you already wrote the trialAlignData function for experiment 1 analysis.
%We can use that function here too, because EMG is also a continuous
%signal like the force. 
align_times = EVENT_TIMES;
time_before = 1;
time_after  = 2; %set this based on how long you held your contractions
[trial_data] = trialAlignData(data, align_times, time_before, time_after, FS);

%create a time-axis for our trial-aligned data (since trial_data itself is
%in samples)
trial_time_emg = linspace(-time_before, time_after, size(trial_data,2));


%now plot the trial-aligned data to check our code worked properly.

%3. Now let's write code to compute the relevant metrics of EMG that we
%will test for our analyses

%3a - mean EMG in a time-window
avg_start = 0; %time to start (in seconds)
avg_end   = 2; %time to end averaging (in seconds) - again, set this based on how long you held your contractions
avg_idx   = (trial_time_emg >= avg_start) & (trial_time_emg <= avg_end); %FILLIN - create a logical vector to indicate the indices of trial_data where trial_time_emg is between your avg_start and avg_end times.

%Hint: mean can operate on a matrix to compute the mean over 1 dimension.
%You want to average over time in your [trials x time] matrix. Use avg_idx created above to
%only take the average over a defined subset of time
emg_amp = mean(abs(trial_data(:,avg_idx)), 2); %FILLIN.


%plot a histogram of the mean emg amplitude across your trials to visualize results
figure
hist(emg_amp,10)
xlabel('Mean rectified EMG (V)') %FILLIN
ylabel('Count') %FILLIN
title('Distribution of EMG ampiltude across trials')



%3b - compute the RMS value (root-mean-square) as a measure of EMG signal variance
%in a given time-window.
%hint: type help for the matlab function 'rms'. It can be used the same way you used 'mean' above.
rms_start = 0; %time to start (in seconds)
rms_end   = 2; %time to end averaging (in seconds) - again, set this based on how long you held your contractions
rms_idx   = (trial_time_emg >= rms_start) & (trial_time_emg <= rms_end); %FILLIN - create a logical vector to indicate the indices of trial_data where trial_time_emg is between your rms_start and rms_end times.

%plot a histogram of the RMS
figure
hist(emg_rms,10)
xlabel('EMG RMS (V)') %FILLIN
ylabel('Count') %FILLIN
title('Distribution of EMG RMS across trials')


%3c - compute the spectral power of the EMG signal
%we have provided a COMPLETED function to compute the periodogram (spectral
%power estimate) for each trial called 'compute_periodogram_fft.m'
%look at the help for this function and use it to analyze your data

%pick time-window for analysis (once force has started)
spec_start = 0; %time to start (in seconds)
spec_end   = 2; %time to end averaging (in seconds) - again, set this based on how long you held your contractions
spec_idx   =  (trial_time_emg >= spec_start) & (trial_time_emg <= spec_end); %FILLIN - create a logical vector to indicate the indices of trial_data where trial_time_emg is between your spec_start and spec_end times.

%note: the muscleBox includes hardware filtering to reduce low-frequency activity.
%We therefore recommend looking at frequencies >70 hz and less than 500 Hz.
fpass = [70 500];
[emg_periodogram, spec_frequency] = compute_periodogram_fft(trial_data(:,spec_idx), FS, fpass); %FILLIN. Remember to only analyze the defined time-window from spec_idx.


%plot the average spectral power across trials
%plot power vs. frequency to visualize

%% Now we will load the data for all files, compute metrics, and make plots

%finally, perform a statistical test to confirm which metric shows the most
%linear relationship to grip-force. Here, you should use the single-trial data
%rather than the across-trial averages.
%hint: use the matlab function 'regress' to fit a linear model between the
%metric and grip-force.
%Look at the help for 'regress'.
%Your Y data will be the EMG metric [#total trials across all files x 1]
%Your X data will be [grip_force for each trial; ones(#total trials,1)]. This is a [#tital trials  x 2] matrix
%we add the constant '1' values to allow our linear model to have a
%non-zero intercept.
%
%Hint for creating the X matrix quickly (i.e. without a for-loop):
%If I have a vector A = [5 4 3 2 1], and a vector B = [1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4]
%I can index vector A by the vector B by calling  "A(B)" which returns [5 5 4 4 3 3 2 2] for the example above.
%You can do the same procedure for grip_force and trial_file_id to make X.
%
%To test how well the linear model fits, use the variance explained by the
%linear model (R^2). This is computed by 'regress'. Look at the help to see
%how to get that value back.
